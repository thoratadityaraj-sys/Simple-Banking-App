# Simple-Banking-App

I built this project to practice Python fundamentals, focusing on while loops, conditional statements (if/elif/else), and user input handling. It mimics the logic of an ATM machine.

 ## Features
 Here is what the application allows you to do:

**Check Balance:** View your current account balance.

**Deposit Money:** Add funds to your account.

**Withdraw Money:** Withdraw funds (checks for sufficient balance).

**KYC Management:** Check the status of your KYC (Know Your Customer) document and update it if necessary.
